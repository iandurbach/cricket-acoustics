All the files contained in this repo were used for my research: Individual recognition of field crickets using acoustics.

The only .R file contains functions that were used to segment the acoustic recordings and also to extract the MFCC features.
There are multiple .py files in this repo.

The functions.py file contains functions that implement classification models as well as functions to carry out more signal precocessing such as decimation.

The rest of the .py files are named according to the features/inputs that were used to train the different classification
models. Each file contains preprocessing that is specific to that type of feature data to be used for that particular type of classification model.
