# research-code
All the files contained in this repo were used for my research.

The only .R file contains functions that were used to segment the acoustic recordings and also to extract the MFCC features.
There are multiple .py files in this repo.
The functions.py file contains some functions that were used during the classification process after the recordings
were segmented and features extracted using the .R script.
The rest of the .py files are named according to the features/inputs that were used to train the different classification
models.
